You: what is agent?
AI: The term "agent" has several meanings depending on the context. Here are a few common ones:

*   **In general terms:** An agent is someone or something that acts on behalf of another person or entity. It's an intermediary or a representative.

*   **In a business context:** An agent is a person or company authorized to act on behalf of another party, often in sales, marketing, or representation. Examples include real estate agents, insurance agents, and talent agents.

*   **In computer science/AI:** An agent is an entity (software, robot, or human) that can perceive its environment through sensors and act upon that environment through actuators. Intelligent agents are designed to be autonomous and make decisions to achieve specific goals.

*   **In chemistry/biology:** An agent is a substance or force that can produce a particular effect. Examples include chemical agents or infectious agents.
